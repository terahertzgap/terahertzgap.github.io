Over the years, every time I've decided to start blogging again, I've always found myself wondering about what to 
write for the first post.

Definitely not _Hello, World_!

After taking a relatively long hiatus from writing, I needed a fresh start. 

This meant not only setting up a new static website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), but also choosing a brand-new name.

One of my passions is keeping up with the latest breakthroughs in science and technology.

It's also something I need to regularly do to stay competitive in my field of work as an engineer.

Occasionally, I find myself in a Wikipedia rabbit hole, without knowing how I exactly got there.

With the thought of needing a new name in the back of my mind, I stumbled upon the page about the
[terahertz gap][1].

It refers to a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, somewhere between the infrared and the microwave bands, with 
wavelengths between 3 mm and 30 Î¼m [[1]].

The reason why it's named the terahertz _gap_ is that there are currently no practical methods for making devices 
that send or receive these waves.

On top of that, due to their short wavelengths, terahertz waves can get easily absorbed by the water vapor in 
the air [[2]].

However, while there are major obstacles in the way, it doesn't mean that it's impossible to get there.

[A quick search in Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&scisbd=1&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=%22terahertz+gap%22) 
shows that new papers keep getting published, each taking us one step closer to a breakthrough.

That's when I had the Aha! Moment. 

I found a new name that aligns with my interests and makes for an intriguing first post.
